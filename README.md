# reviewer_emails

This script reads a CSV of Udacity project reviewer data and generates a spreadsheet that can be used to email all project reviewers, or reviewers for specific projects only, via SendGrid.

### Defaults (can be changed while running the script)
* Only iOS ND reviewers are in the spreadsheet
* Udacity email addresses are not included
* Only certified reviewers are in the spreadsheet
* Waitlisted reviewers are not included.

### How to use this script
* Download a CSV of all project reviewers
* Rename the CSV 'all_reviewers.csv' and move it to the same directory as the script
* Modify the script as needed for your desired custom output
* Run the script. The output will be in 'output.csv'.

### Step 1: Downloading the CSV from reviews-api
* Go to https://review-api.udacity.com/admin/certification
* Click on 'Export found Certifications'
* In the tab that opens, deselect 'Select All Fields'
* Under 'Fields from certifications', select 'Status'
* Under 'Fields from associated grader', select 'Name' and 'Email'
* Under 'Fields from associated project', select 'ID'
* At the bottom of the page, click on 'Export to CSV' to initiate the download.

Note: You can select any or all the fields, but choosing the ones mentioned above will require the least amount of massaging of the source code for your desired output. 

### Step 2: Renaming and moving the CSV
* Locate the downloaded CSV.
* Rename it 'all_reviewers.csv' (required for the script to run properly)
* Move it to the same directory as the 'get\_reviewer\_emails.py' script

### Step 3: Modifying the defaults for custom output
* Open the source code file 'get\_reviewer\_emails.py'
* If your downloaded CSV contains additional fields than the ones listed in Step 1, check the row subscripts on lines 22â€“26 of the script to make sure that they accurately reflect the columns in the downloaded CSV: Line 22 should have the column with the certification status; Lines 23 and 26, the one with the email address; lines 24 and 25, the one with the Project ID
* On line 22 the default `in [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 78]` will provide iOS ND reviewers. Type in a list of the project IDs for the projects whose reviewers you wish to email. E.g., if you want to email just the Spotify Streamer and Popular Movies reviewers, replace `in [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 78]` with `in [59, 60, 66, 67]`
* If you want to email reviewers for all projects, delete line 25 and add a colon to the end of line 24
* If you want to retain reviewers with an @udacity.com address, delete line 23
* If you want to retain non-certified reviewers, change the `and` on line 23 to `if`, then delete line 22
* Save your changes and close the source code file. 

### Step 4: Running the script and getting the output
* At the command line, `cd` to the directory that has the 'get\_reviewer\_email.py' script
* Type `python get_reviewer_email.py`
* The script will run and generate a list of unique reviewers for the projects specified.
* The output will be in 'output.csv'. This can be used in SendGrid.

### Known Issues
* No error checking. The script will crash if the CSV has any errors, or if the above instructions are not followed exactly
* Modifications being needed to the source code is undesirable
* The output file has a useless column for Project ID. Since reviewers typically can review multiple projects, the column has just one of those projects.
